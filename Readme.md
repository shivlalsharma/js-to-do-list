# To-Do List

A simple and interactive To-Do list application where users can add, edit, and remove tasks. It provides an easy way to manage daily tasks with a clean and responsive interface.

## Deployment

This project is live and accessible online. You can try it out here: [To Do List](https://to-do-list30.netlify.app/)

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit an existing task by clicking the "Edit" button, modifying the task, and saving it by clicking "done."
- **Remove Tasks**: Users can remove a task by clicking the "Remove" button next to it.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes to ensure usability across devices.
- **No To-Do Message**: If the list is empty, a message "No to-dos yet" is displayed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the to-do list (adding, editing, and removing tasks).
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive layout and styling components.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a task into the input field and clicks the "Add" button.
2. The task is added to the list below the input field. If it's the first task, the default "No to-dos yet" message is removed.
3. The user can edit any task by clicking the "Edit" button. The task turns into an input field, and the user can change the task text and click "done" to save it.
4. The user can remove any task by clicking the "Remove" button next to it.
5. If all tasks are removed, the "No to-dos yet" message is displayed again.
